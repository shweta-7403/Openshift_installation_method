# 🚀 DO322 - OpenShift Installation Deep Dive

Welcome to the DO322 Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to mastering the installation and provisioning of Red Hat OpenShift clusters using various methods and environments.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 📦 Describe the OpenShift Installation Process

Gain a solid understanding of how OpenShift installation works, the components involved, and the lifecycle of cluster provisioning.

---

### ⚙️ Compare Installation Methods

**🔁 Full Stack Automation (FSA)**  
Provisioning clusters **with infrastructure automation** (e.g., AWS, vSphere) where the installer handles everything — from VM creation to OpenShift setup.

**🛠️ Pre-existing Infrastructure (UPI)**  
Provisioning clusters **manually on user-provided infrastructure**. You set up VMs, networking, and load balancers — and then the installer deploys OpenShift.

---

## ☁️ Cloud-Based Installation

### 📥 Install OpenShift in a Cloud Provider

Automate the provisioning of OpenShift clusters on IaaS platforms (like AWS, Azure, or GCP) using **Full Stack Automation**. Customize cluster size, networking, storage, and more.

---

## 🖥️ Virtualization-Based Installation

### 💻 Install OpenShift on a Virtualized Environment

Provision OpenShift on platforms like **Red Hat Virtualization (RHV)**, **vSphere**, or **KVM**, using both:

- ✅ Full Stack Automation (when supported)
- 🛠️ Pre-existing Infrastructure (manual configuration)

---

## 🧱 Infrastructure-less Installation

### 🧰 Plan to Install OpenShift without an Infrastructure Provider

Prepare your environment by configuring DNS, load balancers, storage, and VMs manually. Ensure prerequisites are met before installation begins.

---

### 🏗️ Install OpenShift without an Infrastructure Provider

Manually deploy OpenShift using UPI method in bare-metal or disconnected environments. You control every step of the provisioning process.

---

### 🧹 Post-Installation Essentials

Complete tasks such as:

- ✅ Setting up user authentication
- ✅ Configuring default storage
- ✅ Setting up cluster monitoring & logging
- ✅ Preparing for application onboarding

---

## 🎯 Goal

By the end of this learning path, you'll be able to confidently provision OpenShift clusters in **cloud**, **virtual**, and **bare-metal** environments using **both FSA and UPI** methods.
